# Destructuring Assignment


As developers, sometimes we receive information and we don't know exactly how
it's going to come in, how much is going to come in, or exactly what's going to
be contained within it - but there's going to be some part of it that's going to
be predictable, and _that's_ the part of it that we want to parse and deal
with. This is especially helpful in cases where we might get pieces of data that
are required, such as name and email address, but also optional pieces of data,
such as phone number or Instagram username. This is where JavaScript
`destructuring` comes in. `destructuring` allows us to extract data from arrays,
objects, maps, and sets into their own variable.


## Use Destructuring to Assign Data to Variables

In JavaScript, when we want to assign data to single variables from a top level
object such as this, we normally do it individually like so:

```js
const doggie = {
  first: 'Buzz',
  breed: 'Great Pyrenees',
  fur_color: 'black and white',
  activity_level: 'sloth-like',
  favorite_food: 'hot_dogs'
};
const first = doggie.first;  // Buzz
const breed = doggie.breed; // Great Pyrenees

```

This is pretty repetitive code, and it feels like there should be an easier way
to do this. With `destructuring`, there is! JavaScript gives us the ability to
assign multiple single variables at one time using a simple syntax.

```js

const doggie = {
  first: 'Buzz',
  breed: 'Great Pyrenees',
  fur_color: 'black and white',
  activity_level: 'sloth-like',
  favorite_food: 'hot_dogs'
};

const { first, breed } = doggie;
console.log(first);
console.log(breed);

```

We can also use it to destructure a nested syntax:
```js

const doggie = {
  first: 'Buzz',
  breed: 'Great Pyrenees',
  fur_color: 'black and white',
  activity_level: 'sloth-like',
  favorite_foods: {
    meats:{
      ham: 'smoked',
      hot_dog: 'oscar_meyer',
    },
    cheeses:{
      american: 'kraft'
    }
  }
};

const { ham, hot_dog } = doggie.favorite_foods.meats;
console.log(ham);
console.log(hot_dog);

```

### Destructuring Assignment with Arrays

Destructuring does not just work on objects - we can also use the same syntax
with arrays as well.

```js

const dogs = ['Great Pyrenees', 'Pug', 'Bull Mastiff']
const [medium, small, giant] = dogs
console.log(medium, small, giant) // Great Pyrenees, Pug, Bull Mastiff
```

The cool part is we can pick the parts of the array that we want to assign!
```js

const dogs = ['Great Pyrenees', 'Pug', 'Bull Mastiff']
const [, small, giant] = dogs
console.log(small , giant) //  Pug, Bull Mastiff
```

### Destructuring Assignment with Strings

We can also destructure with strings, as a whole:

```js

const dogsName = 'Sir Woody BarksALot'
const [title, firstName, lastName] = 'Sir Woody BarksALot'.split(' ')
console.log(title, firstName, lastName) // Sir Woody BarksALot

```

And we can also destructure it in parts, just as we did with arrays above:

```js

const dogsName = 'Sir Woody BarksALot'
const [title, ,lastName] = 'Sir Woody BarksALot'.split(' ')
console.log(title, lastName) // Sir BarksALot

```

## Instructions

We are going to give you several strings, arrays, and objects and you're going
to write several destructuring assignments for each. Write your code in the
`index.js` file. Let the instructions in the README and the tests guide you
through the process.

## Conclusion

"Destructuring assignment" is a fast, and efficient way to assign data to
variables from objects, arrays, and strings. It allows us to pick and choose the
pieces of data that we want to assign, and gives us lots of freedom to
manipulate the data as it is coming in. With practice, you'll be proficient at
it in no time.
